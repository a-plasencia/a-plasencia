## About Me

I'm Alex, a web developer who's on a never-ending journey to get a little better at coding every day.  I graduated from California State University, Fullerton with a major in Japanese and a minor in Computer Science, but decided that the web developer life was the life for me.  I think what really draws me to web development is both the process and the satisfaction of seeing the project come together and finish.
