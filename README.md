### Heyo, I'm Alex 👋

## About Me

I'm Alex, a web developer who's on a never-ending journey to get a little better at coding every day.  I graduated from California State University, Fullerton with a major in Japanese and a minor in Computer Science, but decided that the web developer life was the life for me.  I think what really draws me to web development is both the process and the satisfaction of seeing the project come together and finish.  

## Fun Facts

🐱 Although more of a dog lover, I've recently began living with a cat.  Her name is Kief and she's really been winning me over on how cool cats are (they are so chill)!

🎮 I in my spare time compete in video games.  Specifically Super Smash Bros. Melee and other fighting games.  I have at times travelled the country to play in tournaents, and it's really taught me my love of travel and eating the local food in the area.  

🌱 I've recently began to get into gardening and have been tending to flowers.  It's been a really new learning experience but it's been giving a new spice to my day to day life.
